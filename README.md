# Erik-Save-my-Data
Erik: Save my Data is a project to help recover data due to an accident.

How come? I created videos and edited them very well and made movies as well. Probably, I installed a program on the computer to install data on flash drives. The installation window warned that the chosen stick is permanently formatted. And you know what happened? I unintentionally clicked Continue and... boom! Data deleted. I tried downloading dozens of programs to the computer to recover data, but you need the subscription.
Since I am only a child, my parents do not allow me to subscribe, even for a whole day. I promised that after recovery, I would cancel my subscription. But nothing. It didn't work. All my works saved there: lost! But if you contribute to my project, we will become a force and we will be able to make a more beautiful flash drive. Oh, I shouldn't say stick anymore. On hard drive, or rather, on the web.
Because data can be formatted automatically on USB sticks. Never put data on a stick, especially if important, like my stick. 

I've been trying to retrieve my content for months, so I need help. I am looking for some programs that do not require money. One thing I found is [Recuva](https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva), a program that can recover files but on my flash drive is unreliable. In fact my USB stick disconnects automatically so I don't have a full recovery. Sometimes files also appear that I didn't create, but maybe saved locally before purchase, or maybe they're storage usage logs.

If you have any ideas about free recovery programs, contact me (see email at the bottom of the page)
