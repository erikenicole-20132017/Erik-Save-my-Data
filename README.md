# Erik-Save-my-Data
Erik: Save my Data is a project to help recover data due to an accident.

How come? I created videos and edited them very well and made movies as well. Probably, I installed a program on the computer to install data on flash drives. The installation window warned that the chosen stick is permanently formatted. And you know what happened? I clicked Continue and... boom! Data deleted. I tried downloading dozens of programs to the computer to recover data, but you need the subscription.
Since I am only a child, my parents do not allow me to subscribe, even for a whole day. I promised that after recovery, I would cancel my subscription. But nothing. It didn't work. All my works saved there: lost! But if you contribute to my project, we will become a force and we will be able to make a more beautiful flash drive. Oh, I shouldn't say stick anymore. Oh, I shouldn't say stick anymore. On hard drive, or rather, on the web.
Because data can be formatted automatically on USB sticks. Never put data on a stick, especially if important, like my stick.
